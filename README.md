# Description

This is my Neovim configuration that I use for personal and professional development. I started learning Neovim
using kickstart.nvim (https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). Since then, I have added on and changed plugins
and keybindings to suit my needs.

# Important Note

Jellybeans is the best colorscheme.
